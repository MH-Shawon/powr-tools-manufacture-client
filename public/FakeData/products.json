        "description": "Tackle demanding jobs with this high-performance 60V MAX* 1-1/4 in. Brushless Cordless SDS PLUS Rotary Hammer. Capable of outputting up to 4.5 J of impact energy, this rotary hammer comes equipped with a DEWALT brushless motor and German-engineered mechanism for fast drilling and chipping in even the hardest concrete. The midweight design makes it ideal for structural connections, beam and column anchorage, rod hanging, seismic and safety attachments, cable tray and strut mounting, and steel stanchion mounting. Part of the PERFORM & PROTECT™ product line, this hammer is integrated with the Anti-Rotation E-CLUTCH® System and the SHOCKS Active Vibration Control® System. E-CLUTCH® shuts down the tool in bind up situations. SHOCKS® reduces vibration felt by the user at the handles, compared to rotary hammers without this feature. Link the DCH416 to the DCV585 60V MAX* dust extractor for remote extractor activation with WIRELESS TOOL CONTROL™. This tool is Tag-Ready with a designated area for DCE041 Tag palcement. The DCE041 Tag is designed to be tracked with the TOOL CONNECT™ System via the DEWALT Site Manager™ app. This rotary hammer becomes OSHA Table 1 Compliant when used with the DWH200D shroud and DCV585 dust extractor."
